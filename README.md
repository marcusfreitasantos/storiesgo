# STORIES GO! - MOBILE APP
This project is a personal project for a mobile application.

## About the project
This application is a mobile app that I made using React Native CLI. This app uses the GPT-3 api to generate ideas for social media content. The backend was made by another developer and it's responsible for user registration and authentication.

## The features are:
- Create and edit account;
- Generate 3 new ideas for social media content every day;
- Copy and share the generated content by email or social media apps;
- Trial period for 7 days since account registration;

## Built with
React Native | Styled Components

## Deploy
The app is available on PlayStore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.storiesgo
